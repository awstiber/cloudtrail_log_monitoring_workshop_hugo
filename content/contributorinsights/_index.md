Contributor Insights analyzes time-series data to provide a view of the top contributors influencing system performance. You can create Contributor Insights rules to evaluate patterns in CloudTrail logs in real-time and display reports that show the top contributors and number of unique contributors in a dataset. Analyzing the top contributors helps to identify the source of an operational issue due to API throttling, identifying bad actors or an anomalous incident in the account.

Contributor Insights helps you understand who or what is impacting your system and application performance by pinpointing outliers, finding the heaviest traffic patterns, and ranking the top system processes. You can create Contributor Insights rules to evaluate patterns in structured log events as they are sent to CloudWatch Logs, including logs from AWS services like AWS CloudTrail, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, Amazon API Gateway, and any custom logs sent by your service or on-premises servers, such as Apache access logs.
