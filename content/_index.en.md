Welcome to the <span style="color: #FF9900;font-weight:bold">One Observability Demo</span> workshop. This workshop is aimed at providing an hands-on experience for you on the wide variety of toolsets AWS offers to setup monitoring and observability on your applications. 

Whether your workload is on-prem or on AWS, or your application is a giant monolith or based on modern microservice based architecture, our observability tools can help you get deeper insights into your application performance and health. 

Our cost effective and native solutions provide powerful capabilities that enable you to identify bottle necks, issues, and defects without you having to manually sift through various logs, metrics and trace data. 

Go ahead and play around with the workshop and please feel free to provide your feedback.
