## Custom Event Engine template
We have created a custom template which you need to use to provision accounts for workshops. [Reach out](https://amazon.enterprise.slack.com/user/@W017PE1V36G) to get access to the template.

## Opportunities to collaborate  <i  style="color: #FF9900;" class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i>
If you are an AWS employee, I'm looking for your help to enhance the content and build new modules in the workshop.

See the list of items I'm currently tracking - https://github.com/aws-samples/one-observability-demo/issues
